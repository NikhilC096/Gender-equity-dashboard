## Overview

This repository hosts a suite of interactive Power BI dashboards designed to analyze Diversity & Inclusion metrics with a special focus on gender equity, hiring trends, promotions, turnover, and performance ratings. The dashboards provide actionable insights to empower HR teams and leadership to make data-driven decisions for fostering an inclusive workplace.


## Project Objectives

- **Monitor Gender Equity:** Evaluate hiring ratios, promotions, and turnover to assess gender balance in leadership roles.
- **Analyze Key Metrics:** Dive into performance ratings, job-level diversity, and demographic distributions.
- **Support Decision-Making:** Offer interactive visualizations with drill-down capabilities to empower strategic planning.
- **Promote Inclusivity:** Use data insights to drive proactive changes and foster a more inclusive work environment.

## Data Collection & Preparation

- **Data Sources:** Employee HR databases, demographic surveys, and performance management systems.
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardized job-level definitions, unified date formats, and addressed missing or inconsistent data.
- **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between key datasets in Power BI for robust analysis.

> **Pro Tip:** Conducting a “data dictionary workshop” with stakeholders ensured clarity in definitions and improved overall data quality.

## Methodology & Tools

- **ETL Process:** Utilized Power Query for effective data cleaning and transformation.
- **Data Analysis:** Employed DAX formulas to calculate KPIs such as turnover rates, promotion counts, and performance averages.
- **Dashboard Design:** 
  - Developed interactive visuals with dynamic slicers and drill-through features.
  - Emphasized accessibility by using colorblind-friendly palettes and clear, concise layouts.

> **Design Note:** The visualizations are crafted to not only display data but also to narrate the progress and challenges of the organization in a compelling way.

### Gender Equity in Leadership

- **Hiring Metrics:** Visual comparisons of male vs. female hiring ratios.
- **Promotions Analysis:** Insights into promotion trends across various job levels.
- **Turnover Insights:** Detailed examination of departure rates with a focus on gender differences.

### Diversity & Inclusion Metrics

- **Performance Ratings:** Breakdown of performance scores by gender.
- **Executive Gender Balance:** Visual representation of leadership roles by gender.
- **Demographic Distribution:** Analysis of age, nationality, and regional diversity.


## Key Insights & Findings

- **Hiring Imbalance:** Certain job levels reveal notable disparities in gender representation.
- **Promotion Trends:** A slight overrepresentation of males in senior roles highlights the need for targeted mentorship programs.
- **Retention Patterns:** Higher turnover rates in specific regions point to underlying challenges.
- **Performance vs. Promotion:** Despite comparable performance ratings, the data indicates a gap in promotion outcomes between genders.

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Data Quality:**  
   - *Challenge:* Handling incomplete or inconsistent data records.  
   - *Solution:* Developed custom Power Query scripts to validate and cleanse data effectively.

2. **Diverse Stakeholder Needs:**  
   - *Challenge:* Meeting varied KPI requirements across different teams.  
   - *Solution:* Implemented dynamic slicers and drill-through pages to allow tailored data views.

3. **Sensitive Data Handling:**  
   - *Challenge:* Ensuring privacy when working with sensitive demographic information.  
   - *Solution:* Aggregated data appropriately to maintain confidentiality while still offering actionable insights.

> **Collaboration Insight:** Informal "data coffee chats" with stakeholders led to iterative improvements, ensuring the dashboards aligned with real-world needs.

## Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics:** Integrate machine learning models to forecast trends and identify retention risks.
- **Expanded Metrics:** Incorporate additional diversity dimensions such as race, disability, and veteran status.
- **Scenario Modeling:** Develop “What-If” analysis features to simulate the impact of policy changes.
- **Automated Alerts:** Implement notification systems to alert stakeholders when key metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
